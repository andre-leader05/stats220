# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

* I am undertaking a degree in **Chemistry** in **Statistics**
* I am taking *STATS 220* because I wish to broaden my general data science skills, and reinforce my ability to code in R
* I am interested in learning about data structures and how data is stored

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)

Some of my goals for this year include:
1. Sit Japanese proficiency test N2
2. Go to Japan for a working holiday
3. Keep up my Chemistry and Statistics studies

I am currently doing part-time work at [Ramen Takara](https://www.ramentakara.co.nz/) in Browns Bay. ![](https://tenor.com/en-GB/view/dragon-ball-goku-eating-noodles-food-gif-16744504)
