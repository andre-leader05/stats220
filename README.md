# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Chemistry in Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I wish to broaden my general data science skills, and reinforce my ability to code in R
- I am interested in learning about data structures and how data is stored

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
